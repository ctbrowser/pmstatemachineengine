#Exported functions

# The first line within the extern "C++" block (the
# *sme::*; line) exports the typeinfo. For more info,
# see "Working with GNU Export Maps" - http://accu.org/index.php/journals/1372.
#
# @todo we should probably be using
# "__attribute__ ((__visibility__ ("default")))" instead for more granular,
# explicit control of what's to be exported.
